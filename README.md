Posthook Mock Server
Posthook is a service that enables developers to automate and streamline post-receive tasks and processes in their software development workflow. It is commonly used in scenarios where actions need to be triggered automatically after a code repository receives new commits or changes.

The hosted mock server empowers you to effortlessly simulate various Posthook APIs, and doesn't need any authentication/api-key. The setup is straightforward, you can configure the base URL in your code/SDK. You can also control the base URL using environment variables or a feature flag. You don't need any additional dependencies, and you can run the same code in both sandbox and production environments
